## Deep Implicit Attention

_The return of the Boltzmann machine_

---

Experimental implementation of deep implicit attention in PyTorch.

**Key idea:** Use deep equilibrium networks to implicitly solve a set of self-consistent mean-field equations of a random Ising model: attention as a collective response ðŸ¤—.

## Setup

Install package in editable mode:

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

Run tests with:

```bash
$ python -m unittest
```

## Examples

See `tests` for now until `examples` folder is populated.
